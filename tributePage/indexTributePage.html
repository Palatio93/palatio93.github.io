                <h2>Description of Arthas's life</h2>
                <li>
                    Prince <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> Menethil</span> was born to King Terenas Menethil II and Queen Lianne Menethil, four years before the start of the First War. The young prince grew up in a time when the lands of Azeroth were ravaged by war, the Alliance was crumbling, and darker clouds still loomed on the horizon.
                </li>

                <li>
                    As a youth, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> was trained in combat by Muradin Bronzebeard, the brother of the dwarven king Magni Bronzebeard, and became an adept swordsman. At the same time he learned the ways of the Light under the tutelage of Uther the Lightbringer.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> was inducted into the Knights of the Silver Hand at the young age of 19. The ceremony was held in the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind City, and was attended by prominent figures such as Genn Greymane, Thoras Trollbane, Daelin Proudmoore, and Jaina Proudmoore
                </li>

                <li>
                    Having grown into a strong, confident young man, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> was headstrong and somewhat arrogant, though none could dispute his bravery and tenacity. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> came to be considered one of the finest swordsmen in Lordaeron, and was famed for counterattacking and defeating the forest troll warbands of Zul'Aman when they began raiding the settlements along the border of Quel'Thalas.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> and Uther were sent to Strahnbrad to defend the town from orcish raids. Weeks later a more vile threat arose in the form of the Plague of Undeath. Jaina and Captain Falric were sent to help <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>, now 24 years old, investigate the strange disease. They fought against the undead at an infested granary, then encountered the necromancer Kel'Thuzad in the town of Brill and pursued him to Andorhal.
                </li>

                <li>
                    When he arrived at Stratholme, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> found that the grain had already been distributed. He knew the people of Stratholme would soon become undead, and ordered Uther and his knights to purge the entire city. Horrified, Uther and several soldiers, such as Sir Thomas Thomson, left with Uther — as did Jaina — while those who remained loyal to <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> joined him in slaughtering the infected citizens.
                </li>

                <li>
                    As <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> began to slay the citizens of Stratholme, he was met by Mal'Ganis himself, who was working to claim their souls. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> sought to destroy them before Mal'Ganis could reach them, and eventually demanded a final showdown with the dreadlord. Mal'Ganis slipped away, however, vowing to meet him in Northrend. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> then set fire to Stratholme, and those fires burn to this day
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> followed Mal'Ganis with a detachment of his troops.  <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> was shocked to come upon his good friend and former mentor Muradin Bronzebeard. At first, Muradin thought <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> was leading a rescue party sent to save his men, who had been besieged by the undead as they searched for the runeblade Frostmourne.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> and his troops continued to press on to Draktharon Keep in search of Frostmourne. As he arrived, Mal'Ganis appeared to him, and foretold his death. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> went to search for Frostmourne with Muradin, leaving his captain to defend the camp.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using an ancient waygate <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>, Muradin, and a small group of men traveled to the vicinity of the fabled runeblade. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> was soon confronted by the Guardian, who tried to keep him from Frostmourne, apparently for his own protection. The Guardian fell, and <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> and Muradin claimed their prize.  Muradin, reading an inscription, reported that the blade was cursed. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> asked the spirits of the cavern for the sword to be released from its icy prison, proclaiming that he would &ldquo;give anything or pay any price, if only they will help him save his people&rdquo;. When the weapon broke free, Muradin was struck by a rogue shard of ice, rendering him unconscious. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> moved to help Muradin, but was dissuaded by the call of Frostmourne in his mind. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> discarded his holy warhammer, then picked Frostmourne up and returned to his base, leaving Muradin for dead. With Frostmourne in hand, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> defeated Mal'Ganis's army, destroyed his base, and finally confronted the demon.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In Northrend, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> became the first of the Lich King's death knights. He was given a suit of saronite armor, and slew many of his own men. Some among them (like Falric, Marwyn and Thassarian) were raised as death knights in <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>'s service.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> returned to Lordaeron months later, after telling his father that he no longer needed to bear the weight of his crown, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> walked up to Terenas and ran Frostmourne through his heart.
                </li>

                <li>
                    When going to recover a mystical urn to transport Kel'Thuzad's remains, the urn was in the keeping of the Knights of the Silver Hand. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> killed two paladins, Ballador the Bright and Sage Truthbearer. He then faced Uther the Lightbringer, who explained that the urn held the ashes of his father, King Terenas. The two engaged in a duel with Uther initially having the upper hand, knocking <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> down and sending Frostmourne flying from his hands. As <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> awaited the killing blow, the sword seemed to find its own way into his hands and he was granted more power by the Lich King. The battle began to turn in <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>' favor. Eventually, Uther, covered in blood from his wounds, fell to his knees and told <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> he hoped there was a special place in hell waiting for him. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> replied that they may never know because he intended to live forever, then delivered the killing blow.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> met heavy resistance from the elves in Quel'Thalas, rallied by Ranger-General Sylvanas Windrunner. Driving their forces before his undead army, he steadily pushed her people back in a swath of destruction towards Silvermoon. Sylvanas tried to warn the vast elven capital of the coming of the Scourge, but <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> destroyed her camps and killed the Ranger-General. To make her pay for her perceived insolence towards him, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> corrupted her elven spirit, transforming it into a horrendous twisted form (a banshee) and enslaving her to the will of the Lich King, forcing her to slay her own people.
                </li>

                <li>
                    After some time and quite a bit of battles, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> rushed to the Frozen Throne to aid the current Lich King. <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> entered the hollow glacier and beheld a winding pinnacle chained to the ice. As he strode up the stairs towards his destiny, the voices of those he had forsaken flooded through his mind. Finally, he reached the pinnacle and before him he saw an icy cask. Inside was a suit of armour, arranged as if seated on a massive throne. Now only one voice spoke to him - the rasping whisper of Ner'zhul: <span id="nerzh-quote">"Return the blade... complete the circle... release me from this prison!"</span> With a great cry of strength, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> brought Frostmourne to bear against the Lich King's icy prison and with a haunting scream, the ice that encased the Frozen Throne and the armour exploded, and shards of the ice scattered on the ground. With Ner'zhul's helm at his feet, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> leaned forward, picked it up, and placed the unimaginably powerful artifact on his head.
                    <br> <br>
                    <p id="lastQuote">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; they spoke together, &ldquo;we are one&rdquo;.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="death">Death of the Lich King</h2>
            <p>
                <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>'s plan nearly succeeded when a group of adventurers, led by Tirion Fordring, assaulted Icecrown Citadel and ascended to the Frozen Throne. The Lich King froze Tirion in a block of ice, and once he was satisfied that the adventurers opposing him were "the greatest fighting force" on Azeroth, he killed them with a single mighty blow. Just as he was about to raise them into undeath, Tirion freed himself and destroyed Frostmourne with the Ashbringer. This released the souls inside, which attacked and immobilized the Lich King. The spirit of Terenas then resurrected the fallen heroes, who helped Tirion mortally wound <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>. With Frostmourne destroyed and the Helm of Domination out of reach, the Lich King returns to who he once was: <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> Menethil. As he lay dying, comforted by the spirit of his father, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> asked if it was over, to which Terenas replied "At long last. No king rules forever, my son." <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> said that he saw only darkness before him, with his eyes rolling back and his hand falling lifelessly to the ground.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In his last moments, <span id="arthas">Arthas</span> saw the kyrian Devos arriving alongside his old teacher Uther to claim his soul. On Devos's urging, and in defiance of the laws of the Shadowlands, Uther subsequently cast <span id="arthas">Arthas</span>'s spirit into the Maw—the realm of eternal suffering.
            </p>

            <h2><span id="arthas">Arthas</span> died at the age of 31.</h2>
